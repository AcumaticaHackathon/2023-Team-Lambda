# 2023-Team-Lambda
This is the repository for Team Lambda's Hackathon project that was held on January 28th & 29th at the 2023 Summit at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.

## Introduction
This project provides a no-code/lo-code integration to push information in real-time to Acumatica.

It leverages existing Import Scenarios screens to allow users to use familiar interfaces for configuration.

The package installs a webhook handler that will automatically create data providers and import scenarios so that the end user can just focus on configuring the mapping of the incoming data without any coding. Once mapped, the scenario is run automatically every time new data is received.
